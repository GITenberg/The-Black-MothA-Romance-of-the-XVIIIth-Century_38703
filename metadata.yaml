description: '"Jack Carstares, the disgraced Earl of Wyndham, left England seven long
  years ago, sacrificing his honor for that of his brother when he was accused of
  cheating at cards.Now Jack is back, roaming his beloved South Country in the disguise
  of a highway-man. Not long after his return, he encounters his old adversary, the
  notorious Duke of Andover, attempting the abduction of the beautiful Diana Beauleigh.
  At the point of Jack''s sword, the duke is vanquished. But foiled once, the Black
  Moth has no intention of failing again"--P. [4] of cover.'
